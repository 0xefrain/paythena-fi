# Paythena - Decentralized Payroll System with Salary-Backed Lending on Ethena Protocol

## 🚀 Overview

Paythena is a decentralized payroll solution built on the Ethena Protocol that revolutionizes traditional salary processing by combining it with innovative salary-backed lending. The system uses USDe (Ethena's synthetic dollar) for stable payments and yield generation, creating a comprehensive financial solution for both Business and contractors.

## Paythena: Problems to Solve 

A. Traditional Payroll Issues

1. Traditional: 
- High Fees: 3-5% international transfer fees,
- Slow Settlement: 2-5 business days,
- NoYield: Idle treasury funds,
- Global  remote talent access.
- Complex Compliance: Manual reporting

2. Web3 Specific: 
- UX/UI: Lack of seamless experience for non-technical users,
- L2 Overwhelming: Overwhelming L2 experiences for users,
- Integration: Complex DeFi interactions.

B. Current Market Gaps

1. Lack of stable decentralized payroll solutions(💡 Mostly Hibrid and Centralized solutions in the market)
2. No yield generation on treasury funds (💡 Ethena and USDe solve these problem with APY up to 25%).
3. Complex DeFi interactions for non-technical users(💡 Paythena will put Strong Focus on UX/UI and balanced between user experience and security)
4. Limited compliance tools(💡 Global compliance maintaining compliance at a local level for every contributor.)
