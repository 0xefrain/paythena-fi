# Paythena - Decentralized Payroll System with Salary-Backed Lending on Ethena Protocol

## üöÄ Overview

Paythena is a decentralized payroll solution built on the Ethena Protocol that revolutionizes traditional salary processing by combining it with innovative salary-backed lending. The system uses USDe (Ethena's synthetic dollar) for stable payments and yield generation, creating a comprehensive financial solution for both Business and contractors.

## Paythena: Problems to Solve 

A. Traditional Payroll Issues

**Traditional**: 
- High Fees: 3-5% international transfer fees,
- Slow Settlement: 2-5 business days,
- NoYield: Idle treasury funds,
- Global  remote talent access.
- Complex Compliance: Manual reporting

**Web3**: 
- UX/UI: Lack of seamless experience for non-technical users,
- L2 Overwhelming: Overwhelming L2 experiences for users,
- Integration: Complex DeFi interactions.

B. Current Market Gaps

- Lack of stable decentralized payroll solutions(üí° **Mostly Hibrid and Centralized solutions in the market**)
- No yield generation on treasury funds (üí° **Ethena and USDe solve these problem with APY up to 25%**).
- Complex DeFi interactions for non-technical users(üí° **Paythena will put Strong Focus on UX/UI and balanced between user experience and security**)
- Limited compliance tools(üí° **Global compliance maintaining compliance at a local level for every contributor.**)
